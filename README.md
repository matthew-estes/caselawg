## App Description

CaseLawg is the modern attorney's best friend. CaseLawg understands how overwhelming case management can be. With CaseLawg, you can focus on what matters most - winning your client's cases - and less on what you did and when you did it to win those cases. CaseLawg can help you organize your cases, collaborate with staff, track your billable time, and compile and even send detail reports to your clients or to the courts.
